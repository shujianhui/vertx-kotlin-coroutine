### Synchronous but non-OS-thread-blocking vertclies make with kotlin coroutine

This project provide some wrap function to convert Vert.x's callback as response value with kotlin-lang and its coroutine lib.  
We copy the origin project [vertx-sync](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-sync) which use quasar to implements such action.  
Please look into [example](https://github.com/stream1984/vertx-kotlin-coroutine/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/example/Example.kt)
